# CONFIG ARG PREFIX RESERVATIONS

All config arg names that start with [a-z] are reserved for the plugin.

All config arg names that start with - are reserved for the plugin.

All config arg names that start with : are reserved for Dist::Zilla.

This will let us say:

  [Plugin]
  :version = 1.23

...which will then assert:  Plugin->VERSION(1.23)

## TODO

Think about applying the same rules to plugin names.  For example, in the
future virtual plugins could be created with names like :Blorgle that do...
stuff.
